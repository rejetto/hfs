This file contains details about the configuration files.

### Where is it stored

Configuration is stored in the file `config.yaml`, exception made for custom HTML which is stored in `custom.html`.

These files are kept in the same folder of `hfs.exe` if you are using this kind of distribution on Windows, 
or `$HOME/.hfs` on other systems, where *$HOME* varies with the system and is the user's home folder.
Anyway, the current working directory (CWD) is printed by HFS in the first lines of the console.

Many things are stored in the CWD, like the plugins you install.
You can decide a different CWD passing `--cwd SOME_FOLDER` parameter at command line.

If you are not sure what your `cwd` is, look in the console, and you'll see that it is printed in one of the first lines.
Here is an example, look at the 6th line:

### How to modify configuration

Configuration can be done in several ways
- accessing the Admin-panel with your browser
    - it will automatically open when you start HFS. Bookmark it.
      If your port is 8000 the address will be http://localhost:8000/~/admin
- directly editing the `config.yaml` file. As soon as you save, it is reloaded and changes are applied
    - if you don't want to use an editor, consider typing this (example) command inside the folder where the config file is:
      `echo "port: 1080" >> config.yaml`
- passing via command line at start in the form `--NAME VALUE`. Values can use JSON syntax.
- using envs in the form `HFS_<uppercase property name>`, like `HFS_PORT=80` if you want to change the config `port`, 
  but the same applies to any other config available. Values can use JSON syntax.
- after HFS has started you can enter console command in the form `config NAME VALUE`
- setting special env `HFS_ENV_BOOTSTRAP=true` will disable other envs when file config.yaml already exists. 
- env `DISABLE_UPDATE` (designed for containers) will disable updating, but check-for-update will still be possible.  

`NAME` stands for the property name that you want to change. See the complete list below.

#### Virtual File System (VFS)

The virtual file system is a tree of files and folders, collectively called *nodes*.
By default, a node is a folder, unless you provide for it a source that's a file.
Valid keys in a node are:
- `name`: this is the name we'll use to display this file/folder. If not provided, HFS will infer it from the source. At least `name` or `source` must be provided.
- `source`: absolute or relative path of where to get the content
- `children`: just for folders, specify its virtual children.
  Value is a list and its entries are nodes.
- `rename`: similar to name, but it's  from the parent node point.
  Use this to change the name of  entries that are read from the source, not listed in the VFS.
  Value is a dictionary, where the key is the original name. No UI.
- `mime`: specify what mime to use for this resource. Use "auto" for automatic detection.
- `url`: when this value is present, the element is a link to the URL you specify.
- `order`: a number that you can set if you want to force the position of this element to the top or the bottom of the list. 
   A positive number for the top, negative for the bottom. If you set "1" for an entry and "2" for another, the "2" will be the topmost.
- `target`: optional, for links only, used to [open the link in a new browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#target). E.g. `_blank`
- `accept`:  valid only on upload folders, used to restrict the type of files you can upload. E.g. `.zip,.rar`
- `default`: use this with a folder where you want to serve a file, instead of the standard page with the list of files.
  The value must be the name of the file to serve. E.g.: `index.html`. 
  The value must be an absolute or relative path in the VFS, not a path on disk. It works also with other type of files.
  Using this will make `mime` default to "auto".
- `can_read`: specify who can download this entry. Value is a `WhoCan` descriptor, which is one of these values
    - `true`: anyone can, even people who didn't log in. This is normally the default value.
    - `false`: no one can.
    - `"*"`: any account can, i.e. anyone who logged in.
    - `[ frank, peter ]`: the list of accounts who can.
    - `can_SOMETHING`: copy the permission from another permission. This is convenient to have same value for different permissions. E.g. `can_see` 
    - `{ this?: WhoCan, children?: WhoCan }`: this form is useful only for folders. By using it, you can have
      different permission for the folder itself and its children. For example, having only the `this` property
      will make the permission limited to the folder and not be inherited by children. Otherwise, having only
      the `children` will make the permission have no effect on the folder, but only on its content.  
        - `this` specifies permission for this folder
        - `children` specifies permission for the content.
- `can_see`: specify who can see this element. Even if a user can download you can still make the file not appear in the list.
  Value is a `WhoCan` descriptor, refer above. Default is `can_read`.
- `can_upload`: specify who can upload. Applies to folders with a source. Default is none.
- `can_list`: specify who can see the content of a folder. Default is `can_read`.
- `can_archive`: specify who can get the zip a folder or a set of files. Default is `can_read`.
- `can_delete`: specify who can delete. Applies to folders with a source. Default is none.
- `masks`: maps a file mask to a set of properties as the one documented in this section. E.g.
  ```
  myfile.txt:
    can_see: false
    can_read: false
  "**/*.mp3":
    can_read: false
  "*.jpg|*.png": 
    mime: auto
  ```
  Rules on top have priority over bottom rules. Inner rules have priority over parent's rules.
  A mask can carry any node property (even property "masks" itself).
  If the mask ends with `|files|`, then it will match only files and not folders.
  You can get the opposite effect with suffix `|folders|`. 

Permissions set on an inner element will override inherited permissions. This means that you can restrict access to folder1,
and yet decide to give free access to folder1/subfolder2.

#### Accounts

All accounts go under `accounts:` property, as a dictionary where the key is the username.
E.g.
```
accounts:
    admin:
        password: hello123
        admin: true
    frank:
        password: another
        belongs: group1
    guest:
        password: guest
    group1:
```

As soon as the config is read HFS will encrypt passwords (if necessary) in a non-reversible way. It means that `password` property is replaced with an encrypted property: `srp`.

As you can see in the example, `group1` has no password. This implies that you cannot log in as `group1`, but still `group1` exists and its purpose is to
gather multiple accounts and refer to them collectively as `group1`, so you can quickly share powers among several accounts.

For each account entries, this is the list of properties you can have:

- `ignore_limits` to ignore speed limits. Default is `false`.
- `redirect` provide a URL if you want the user to be redirected upon login. Default is none.
- `admin` set `true` if you want to let this account log in to the Admin-panel. Default is `false`.
- `belongs` an array of usernames of other accounts from which to inherit their permissions. Default is none.
- `password` a temporary unencrypted password, transformed into `srp` ASAP (and removed).
- `srp` encrypted password. Don't modify this, HFS will create it from `password` field.
- `disabled` prevents using this account. Default is false.
- `expire` account won't work once the time has passed this timestamp. Use JSON timestamp syntax. Default is none.
- `days_to_live` used to set `expire` on first login. Default is none.
- `disable_password_change` set `true` if you want to forbid password change for this user. Default is `false`.
- `require_password_change` set `true` if you want to require password change for this user. Default is `false`.
- `allow_net` a mask of addresses to restrict the access of the account

### Specify another file

Do you need to load a different config file that's not `config.yaml`?
Use this parameter at command line `--config PATH` or similarly with an env `HFS_CONFIG`.
The path you specify can be either a folder, or full-path to the file.
